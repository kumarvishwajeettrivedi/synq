# SYNQ — Collaborative Intelligence, Simplified

## 🧠 What is SYNQ?

**SYNQ lets multiple AI agents work together — reasoning, debating, evaluating, and coding as a team — all inside one unified framework.**

I created SYNQ after realizing something simple:

> Every AI model has different strengths.  
> Some are fast, some reason better, some write cleaner code.  
> Real projects need *all of these* working together.

So I built a platform where multiple agents can collaborate, challenge each other, catch mistakes, and produce far more reliable results than any single model alone.

SYNQ is just the foundation.  
I don’t know everything, and I don't claim to — but with this framework, **you can build something far better than what I started.**
